Gesture Vocalizer is a project for social purpose. Normally deaf people speak with
hand gestures and it is difficult for other people to understand their sign language. We are going
to implement gesture-based vocalizer which will detect all the gestures of deaf people and
convert it into voice and also candisplay it on LCD screen.
